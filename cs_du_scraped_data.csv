Message from the Head of the Department








The Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi is one of the first university departments in India to offer a three-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) programme and two-year Master of Science (M.Sc.) in CS programme at the post-graduate level. With a strength of more than 50 research scholars, the department continually strives to conduct cutting-edge research in all areas across CS. 


Our MCA programme aims to equip students with the core competence of developing high-quality production-grade software, while also cultivating the skillset to keep abreast with the latest state-of-the-art technologies. The curriculum remains kindred to industry requirements, with students spending their final semester at leading technology companies like Amazon, American Express, Nagarro, as well as unicorns like OYO Rooms. These projects span across the entire spectrum of CS - from Database Systems and Computer Networks to Software Engineering, and more recently Machine Learning and Deep Learning. During the project, the students get an opportunity to gain experience working closely with an experienced industry mentor and apply what they learn during their first three semesters in the classroom. Three decades later, our MCA students are holding high positions in the industry, both in India and abroad.


M.Sc. in CS, the flagship programme of our Department, aims at inculcating creative thinking. In addition to mastering foundational theoretical concepts and practical skills, the focus of this programme is to prepare students to conduct high-quality research, via a minor and major project in their third and fourth semesters, respectively. Research projects stretch across diverse areas like Algorithms, Parallel Computing, Computer Security, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, as well as interdisciplinary areas like Human-Computer Interaction, applied Machine Learning etc. A decade later, our alumni have gone on to pursue doctoral studies at top universities in India (DU, IISc, IITs, IIITs etc.), US, Belgium and Japan.


The Department is proud to be part of a 1000-strong-alumni-network, many of whom hold influential positions in the Information Technology industry and academia, at both, national and international levels. We look forward to having talented students, researchers, academicians, and professionals join us and augment the healthy and competitive learning atmosphere we have on campus!

 - Vivek Singh

Spoken Tutorials




 


                    The 'Spoken Tutorial' project is an initiative of National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (ICT), launched by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Government of India. The 'Spoken Tutorial' project is being developed by IIT Bombay for MHRD, Government of India. It is about teaching and learning a particular FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) like Linux, Scilab, LaTeX, PHP & MySQL, Java, C/C++, LibreOffice etc. via an easy Video tool - Spoken Tutorials. Online tests are conducted for students in different FOSS and certificates are issued to those students who qualify the test; so it is beneficial for students to give online tests. 

The Department of Computer Science has been organizing online tests for its students (MCA and M.Sc. Computer Science) from Jan' 2017 in C, C++ and Python. Online tests help in improving the knowledge of our students and brushing up their concepts. The students who have qualified online tests have got certificates.

Srijan








                                                It has been rightly said by Edward Bulwer-lytton that ""The pen is mightier than the sword!"". Indeed, what one can achieve with powerful use of right words at the right time can never be achieved by wars. Keeping these wise words in mind, the students of DUCS come up every year with their annual magazine- Srijan. Every year, a panel of students who swing their pens to express, helm the magazine. Srijan has now become a symbol of amalgamation of views of both the students as well as the teachers on a wide array of technical as well as non-technical topics. Thus, Srijan for us is more than an expression of the self.

        This is the annual tech fest of DUCS which has been our pride for more than a decade now. Since its inception in 2005, it has been a part & parcel of lives at DUCS. Students from universities across India come and participate enthusiastically in this two day event. This is the time when everyone works together as a team and is dedicated towards a common goal to bring pride and honour to the Department. 'Division of labour' is followed here at every step. This keeps the students mentally prepared to perform well in the companies and prepares them to take responsibilities and live up to the expectations. Renowned people from the IT industry and our alumni placed in various tech giant companies judge and review all the technical events held during the fest. After the two days of long grilling experience, students are awarded and appreciated for winning and participating in the fest. A large number of sponsors who financially aid this event form the backbone of the fest.
